- **Context Anchors**: Used AI to maintain consistency across related files
- **Iterative Approach**: Implemented core functionality first, then enhanced with advanced features

## Key Features Implemented

### Analytics Endpoints
1. **User Analytics Overview** (`/analytics/overview`)
   - Total polls created, views, votes
   - Engagement rates and performance metrics
   - Recent activity tracking

2. **Popular Polls** (`/analytics/popular`)
   - Configurable timeframes (day, week, month, year, all)
   - Sorting by votes, views, engagement
   - Pagination support

3. **Poll Performance** (`/analytics/polls/{poll_id}/performance`)
   - Detailed individual poll statistics
   - Vote distribution and engagement metrics
   - Comparative analysis

4. **Trend Analysis** (`/analytics/trends`)
   - Time-series data for polls and engagement
   - Growth metrics and patterns
   - Historical performance tracking
